# Accessible Etymology
# HackUMBC

Our project is based upon the concept of accessible learning, using a display fit for users with dyslexia, color blindness, and other visual disabilities. The code prompts the user to input a word through the terminal based upon a given set of options, and displays the etymology of the words visually in black and white, in Open Dyslexic font, and with custom formatting, based upon the etymology tree which google displays, as recorded in a text file.

With further work, we would like to parse the information from Wiktionary using wiktionary parser.
